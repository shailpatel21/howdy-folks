Issues I ran into:

Getting Git to download on my computer properly
I used the instructions in the installfest doc; that seemed to make it work

Also getting brackets.io to download properly
No matter what I did, it just wouldn't download on Chrome for some reason
I updated chrome, made sure I had enough space to - to no avail. 
I ended up downloading atom instead
