      <p title="I'm a p">Today, during the ThinkLaunch session Wireframe DEUX, We learned quite a bit of vocabulary! Here are my top 10 terms I didn't know before:</p>
      <div class="definition" title="I'm a Definition Div!">
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>Like any language, HTML comes with a set of rules. These rules are relatively simple. It comes down to defining boundaries, to know where something starts and where something ends.</p>

      <div class="definition">
        <h3 title="I'm an H3!">Tag</h3>
        <p>HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <pre title="i'm a pre tag for code!"></p> <p> < html > is the opening tag and < / html > is the closing tag.</pre></p>

        <h3>Element</h3>

        <h3>Class</h3>
        <p>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.</p>

      <div class="definition">
        <h3>ID</h3>
        <p>The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id. Used for Definition and Usage. </p>
